# Introduction to Arsenix

Arsenix is a modern, asynchronous Python library designed for building high-performance, scalable recommendation engines. It provides a flexible and intuitive toolkit for developers to create sophisticated, data-driven features with minimal boilerplate.

## Core Philosophy

The design of Arsenix is guided by three core principles:

1.  **Flexibility**: Arsenix is built to be adaptable. With the powerful `FYPBuilder`, you can create custom recommendation algorithms tailored to your specific needs, from simple content feeds to complex, multi-faceted scoring systems.

2.  **Ease of Use**: We believe that powerful tools should be easy to use. Arsenix provides a clean, declarative API and a set of pre-built strategies that allow you to get up and running in minutes.

3.  **Performance**: Built on `asyncio`, Arsenix is designed for high-concurrency environments, ensuring that your recommendation engine can scale with your application.

## Key Features

- **Rule + Score Mixing Engine**: A declarative, chainable interface for building custom recommendation algorithms.
- **Smart Pre-Built FYP Strategies**: A set of pre-built functions for common use cases like trending and personalized feeds.
- **Pluggable Caching**: Support for multiple caching backends, including local, disk, and Redis.
- **Asynchronous by Design**: Built from the ground up to be fully asynchronous, ensuring high performance and scalability.
