# Introduction to Arsenix

Arsenix is a lightweight, minimalist, and fast Python library designed for high-performance caching, pattern detection, and algorithmic tasks. It is built to be simple, extendable, and efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from backend services and machine learning to embedded systems and games.

## Core Design Goals

- **ðŸ“¦ Lightweight**: With a minimal footprint, Arsenix is designed to be lean. The target installation size is under 500 KB.

- **âš¡ Fast**: Operations are optimized for low latency, using efficient data structures and an asynchronous design to handle concurrent tasks without blocking.

- **ðŸ”Œ Simple API**: The library exposes a clean and intuitive API, with core components like `ArsenixServer`, `ARGetter`, and `ARSetter` that are easy to understand and use.

- **ðŸ“ˆ Extendable**: Arsenix is built with extensibility in mind. Its modular components can be adapted or built upon to fit custom requirements.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm System**: Build custom recommendation engines and scoring systems.
- **Getter / Setter**: A simple and efficient interface for data manipulation.
- **Caching System**: An in-memory cache to store computed results and frequently accessed data.
- **Pattern Detection**: Learn and store user interest patterns to refine recommendations.
- **Async by Default**: All core operations are asynchronous, making Arsenix ideal for modern, high-concurrency applications.
